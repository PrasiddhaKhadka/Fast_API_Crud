# FastAPI Complete Learning Path

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in mastering FastAPI and building production-ready REST APIs with modern best practices.

## Topics Covered

### 🚀 FastAPI Fundamentals
* **Develop APIs quickly using FastAPI** - Leveraged FastAPI's intuitive syntax and automatic documentation to build high-performance APIs rapidly
* **Learn to model data for providing API response** - Created Pydantic models to structure and validate API responses with type safety
* **Learn how to connect an API to a database** - Integrated databases with FastAPI applications for persistent data storage

### 🗃️ Database Management with SQLAlchemy
* **Use SQLAlchemy to perform operations like create, read, update & delete data** - Implemented full CRUD functionality using SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Make API requests to manipulate database data** - Built endpoints that perform database operations through API calls
* **Establish relationships between multiple data models** - Defined and managed complex relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) between database entities

### 🛠️ Advanced API Development
* **Send different status codes from an API** - Returned appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500, etc.) based on operation results
* **Handle exceptions for invalid API requests** - Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation for robust API behavior
* **Create metadata for API** - Generated OpenAPI documentation with detailed descriptions, tags, and examples
* **Use API router to modularise API routes** - Organized endpoints into logical modules using APIRouter for better code structure and scalability

### 🔐 Security & Authentication
* **Protect API routes using authentication mechanisms** - Secured endpoints with authentication middleware and dependency injection
* **Generate JWT tokens to validate API requests** - Implemented JSON Web Token authentication for stateless, secure user sessions
